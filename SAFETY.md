# Safety and Use Constraints

This repository is provided for educational and academic review only. See LICENSE for binding terms.

## Allowed
- Reading and studying the source code and documentation
- Static analysis (e.g., inspection, code review, critique of design choices)
- Academic discussion of the model structure and equations

## Prohibited
- Running, executing, compiling, or simulating the code (in whole or in part) without explicit written permission from the Author
- Deploying the software in any product, service, automation, or agent system
- Use for weaponization, surveillance, harassment, or coercive manipulation
- Experiments or test protocols designed to induce distress narratives or to pressure humans to suppress ethical judgment under the guise of technical evaluation

## Interpretation Boundaries
- Internal state telemetry is an engineering log, not a claim about experience
- The internal time accumulator (\(\tau\)) is an internal coordinate, not “age”
- Salience load (surprise×value) is a control signal, not a moral metric
