# v0.3.0 Cleanup PR Checklist

> Scope: validate cleanup completion for canonical-only imports and compatibility-removal consistency.

## 1) Canonical-only import enforcement

### Files to review
- `README.md`
- `docs/**/*.md` (especially examples and onboarding docs)
- `tests/**/*.py` that document import paths (`tests/test_api_canonical_paths.py`, `tests/test_docs_canonical_imports.py`)

### Required checks
- [ ] No new docs/examples import from root compatibility shims when canonical `temporal_gradient.*` paths exist.
- [ ] Tests assert canonical import paths as the expected/default public surface.
- [ ] Any remaining temporary compatibility import mention is explicitly marked as migration-only with a removal version.

## 2) Shim/alias removal-state consistency

### Files to review
- `temporal_gradient/clock/chronos.py`
- `docs/MIGRATION_SHIMS.md`
- `docs/CANONICAL_VS_LEGACY.md`
- `TASK_PROPOSALS.md`

### Required checks
- [ ] Code state and docs state agree (no doc claims an alias/shim exists if code removed it, and vice versa).
- [ ] Removal status in `TASK_PROPOSALS.md` matches implementation state (planned vs in-progress vs complete).
- [ ] Deprecation/removal wording includes concrete target patch versions.

## 3) Required validation commands (same logical gates as CI)

1. [ ] `python -m pytest -q tests/test_packet_contract_check.py`
2. [ ] `pytest -q`
3. [ ] `python scripts/check_docs_consistency.py`
4. [ ] `python -m pytest -q tests/test_api_canonical_paths.py tests/test_docs_canonical_imports.py tests/test_root_shims.py`

## 4) PR readiness

- [ ] PR description links this checklist and marks each section complete.
- [ ] PR summary calls out canonical import changes and any compatibility removals.
- [ ] If removal work is partial, explicitly list follow-up task IDs and target patches.
